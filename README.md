# AI-Powered Calculator App

## Project Description

The **AI-Powered Calculator App** is an innovative application that allows users to draw shapes on a digital canvas, which the app then interprets to perform various mathematical calculations. This app leverages machine learning for shape recognition, enabling users to obtain immediate calculations for common geometric shapes, such as circles and triangles.

### Key Features
- **Intuitive Drawing Interface:** Users can easily draw shapes using a simple and responsive canvas interface.
- **Shape Recognition:** Employs advanced machine learning algorithms to identify drawn shapes in real-time.
- **Dynamic Calculations:** Automatically computes relevant mathematical properties based on the recognized shapes, including:
  - For circles: radius, area, circumference
  - For triangles: sides, hypotenuse (Pythagorean theorem), area
- **User Feedback:** Instant display of calculation results with options for modification and resubmission of drawings.
- **History Feature:** Keeps a record of past calculations and drawings for easy reference.
